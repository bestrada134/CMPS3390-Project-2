## Usage

Clone the repository, then change into the directory. 
Then run the install so the packages are installed for the npm project, so you can start the npm project.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bestrada134/CMPS3390-Project-2.git

cd CMPS3390-Project-2

npm install

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
